Contains tools for generating metadata about the set of Chromium commits linked
to a given list of bugs, as well as concrete data for the Identity Service
project. See ./data for the Identity Service data, and the README file in that
directory for information on how that data was generated (which could also serve
as a template for generating data about another set of bugs).
